Tictactoe Theory and Complete List of All Openings

This document covers basics of Tictactoe theory and list of all openings.
First of all it should be explained what a "Tictactoe opening".

GAME EXAMPLES DISCLAIMER
------------------------

In all shown below game examples X is the starting player.

THEORY
------

Tictactoe game is divided into 3 parts:
- opening (3 first moves, 2 of starting player and one of second player),
- mid game (4 next moves),
- end game (2 last moves),
Move is one placement of piece on the board, eg.
- X -
O - -
- - - here two moves has been made.

Opening has its subpart - halfopening, it is first 2 moves.
There are 12 original halfopenings (excluding rotations and symetrical ones).
This is an example of halfopening:
X - -
- O -
- - -
To make it an opening you need to do one more move - response:
X - -
- O X
- - - now this is an opening (after X response)
After opening next four moves are mid game, this is when main game really happens and most victories are done.
After mid game 2 last moves are end game. Usually they don't matter really, but in some bizzarre openings victory happens now.
Now lets proceed to openings list.

OPENINGS LIST DISCLAIMER
------------------------

Each opening has informations about its outcome (Draw, O win or X win), to calculate it I have assumed rational game and players doing perfect and optimal moves.
To make it look more professional and give Tictactoe more respect each opening has its own unique name (like in Chess).
Also this list does not contain rotations and symmetrical openings as they are essensialy same, there are only unique openings (in terms of gameplay).
However these names were done by me and my friends so they are subject to change.
All "characters" which few openings are named after are fictional characters from some god-forgotten fantasy universe (except historical characters like Romulus or Pythagoras).
X is always a starting player.
